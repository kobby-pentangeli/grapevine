# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, feedback and contributions from the community are greatly valued.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure reviewers have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

Kindly use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/kobby-pentangeli/grapevine/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/kobby-pentangeli/grapevine/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20) issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of the code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work.

To send a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for reviewers to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.
